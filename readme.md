# <Password-Generator>

## Description

-My motivation in this project was to create a html page that generates a random password based on criteria input by the user. 
-This solves the problem of trying to think of random passwords yourself that can be used as strong passwords. 
-In this project I learned about concatenation of arrays, also to generate a random string from a given array.
-This project was a second try at writing efficient code to solve the problem. My first attempt was too complex and used unnecessary switching between strings and arrays.
